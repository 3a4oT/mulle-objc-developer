# mulle-objc-developer

Package all items together into a single homebrew formula.

See [mulle-objc Community](//mulle-objc.github.io) for more information.


## Developing mulle-objc

If you want to hack on `mulle-objc` it is easiest to use the supplied
script  [`mulle-objc-clone.sh`](mulle-objc-clone.sh) to setup things on
your machine.

```
./bin/mulle-objc-clone.sh
```


## Memo

To pick up changes in the formula the URL of the formula must change AFAIK.
